## Artifacts

Specter is available in several forms: as a GUI application, as a binary that can be executed like a web app, and as a PyPI package. Additionally, Specter is available as a Docker image via the awesome [Chiang Mai LN devs](https://github.com/lncm/docker-specter-desktop).

Signed hashsum files are available for all binaries.

## GUI Application

This is a GUI application with a windowed interface, which includes the Specter server.
Supported platforms: [Windows](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/releases/download/{{ data.version }}/Specter-Setup-{{ data.version }}.exe), [MacOS](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/releases/download/{{ data.version }}/Specter-{{ data.version }}.dmg), [Linux (x86_64)](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/releases/download/{{ data.version }}/specter_desktop-{{ data.version }}-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz)

**Note on Linux**: you need to set up udev rules (included in the archive). Check out the [readme](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/blob/master/udev/README.md#usage).

**Note on macOS**: The current build supports only macOS Catalina (10.15) or higher. If you'd like to run Specter on an older macOS version, you can [install Specter from Pip](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop#installing-specter-from-pip).
