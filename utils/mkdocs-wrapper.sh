# This is mainly used by netlify where we're using the free starter-plan
# Checkout https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/pull/1463
# for a more birds eye view of this script.

# The nelify settings for this to work need to be:
# * Repository: github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop
# * Base directory: Not set
# * Build command: ./utils/mkdocs-wrapper.sh build
# * Publish directory: site
# In the Environment Variables, you have to set:
# PYTHON_VERSION 3.8

# We're using mkdocs for creating the static pages
# We don't pin this dependency as this is not relevant for either testing or
# production. Therefore it's easier to simply let it upgrade automatically:
pip3 install mkdocs 
# At the sime of this comment, we had: mkdocs==1.2.3



# We want the README-md file in the root-folder for people browsing github
# but we also want it for people browsing https://docs.specter.solutions/desktop
# So for the second case, we copy it there and change all the links
if [ "$1" = "build" ]; then
    cp README.md docs
    sed -i 's/docs\///g' docs/README.md
    sed -i 's/\.\.\/README.md/README.m/g' docs/*.md

mkdocs $1 $2

# Potentially, we could rollback here the changes but that would be anoying if you want 
# to edit files.
