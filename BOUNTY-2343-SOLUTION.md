# Solution for Issue #2343

## Summary
Error when Jade is being used by a different app can lead Specter to crash

## Implementation
---SOLUTION---
Implement a function to check for open serial ports and close them before running the main application logic. Use `serial.tools.list_ports` to enumerate all open ports and then call `.close()` on each port if it is open.

Ensure this cleanup code runs whenever Specter starts or when Jade integration initializes.
