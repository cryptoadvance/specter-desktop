# Specter API

Specter provides a Rest-API which is, by default, in production deactivated. In order to activate, you need to export a variable like that:
```
export SPECTER_API_ACTIVE=True
```

The Authentication is also necessary if you don't activate any Authentication mechanism.
In order to make reasonable assumptions about how stable a specific endpoint is, we're versioning them via the URL. Currently, all endpoints are preset with `v1alpha` which pretty much don't give you any guarantee.
# Basic Usage

Curl:

```bash
curl -u admin:secret -X GET http://127.0.0.1:25441/api/v1alpha/specter | jq .
```

Python:

```python
import requests
response = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:25441/api/v1alpha/specter', auth=('admin', 'secret'))
json.loads(response.text)
```
