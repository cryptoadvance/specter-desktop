# Build scripts

Run `build-<your-os> <version_number>` file to build everything.

For example, `build-osx.sh 1.2.3` will create `SpecterDesktop-1.2.3.dmg` and `specterd-1.2.3-osx.zip` in the `release` folder.

If you're making a real release, you should append `"make hash"` at the end of your command calling the build script.
This will update the file hash and version name the Specter Desktop app expects to download from GitHub.

# Pyinstaller build

Install requirements:

```bash
virtualenv --python=python3 .buildenv
source .buildenv/bin/activate 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --require-hashes
cd pyinstaller
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --require-hashes
```

Now run:

```bash
pyinstaller specterd.spec
```

And for HWIBridge, run: 

```bash
pyinstaller hwibridge.spec
```

## Code signing the macOS app for Apple GateKeeper

*Note: for this, you'll need to have an active Apple Developer account*

If this is the first time you go through this process, you'll need to first set up the following:

### Apple Developer Certificate for Code-Signing
1. Go to the Apple Developer website: https://developer.apple.com
2. Click `Account` -> `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles`
3. Click the `+` icon to create a new certificate. Select `Developer ID Application` and click `Continue`
4. You'll need now to create a certificate signing request, which you can do by following these instructions: https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/devbfa00fef7, After that you should be able to generate and download the certificate.
5. Download the certificate, then double-click the downloaded certificate to install it in your keychain.

### App Specific Password for authenticating to iTunesConnect for notarization
1. Sign into you Apple ID account: https://appleid.apple.com
2. Go to `Security` -> `App Specific Passwords` and click `Generate Passwordâ€¦`, you'll be asked to enter a label and click `Create`, then you'll receive a new password.
3. Copy the password generated, then open the Terminal and run:
```bash
xcrun altool --store-password-in-keychain-item "AC_PASSWORD" -u "<your-apple-id>" -p "<the-generated-password>"
```

After having these set up, you can use the automated script to sign by passing it 2 extra parameters: 
- Your certificate name, which you can see on the Keychain app going to the sidebar -> `My Certificates` and copying the name of the certificate you've created in step 1.
- Your Apple ID.

With these two, you can run the command like so:
```bash
./build-osx.sh <version_number> "<certificate_name>" "<apple_id>" "make-hash"
```
*Note: "make-hash" is optional and will automatically calculate hash of specterd generated for the macOS app. Should be used only for real release.*

This should take 10 minutes, during which you should receive an email from Apple notifying whatever the notarization was successful.
If for some reason the notarization failed, you'll be able to get the reason by copying the `Request Identifier` (you should be able to find this in the email and in the logs).
Then run the following command:
```bash
xcrun altool --verbose --notarization-info <request_identifier> -u "<apple_id>" -p "@keychain:AC_PASSWORD"
```
This will output a long message, at the end of which you should have be able to find the `LogFileURL:`.
This URL should contain a JSON with the issues found by Apple and which you'll need to fix to be able to pass Apple's notarization.
